# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Some Functions Like Showing Title and Source url voilates some Chrome Web Security Policy As it is just a frontend project there is no backend to overcome this CORS Problem. Please open the url after disablying web security in Chrome
 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run  **npm install** in the Command Prompt in the metadata_as folder

### `Packages need to install`

 *validator package*
 **npm install validator**

 *Bootstrap*
 **npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0**

 *URL-Metadata*
 **npm install url-metadata --save`**

### `npm start`

To run the application.

***Note:- It wont Directly work on LocalHost Because it voilates the Policy you will get CORS Warning***

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

** Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! **

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Packages used in This Project `
** validator **
This is used to validate the url you have to install its package
